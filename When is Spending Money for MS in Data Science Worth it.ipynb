    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, world! My name is Kyle Compton, and I like many others am answering the call of the 21st century gold rush: data science. Six months ago, after the global covid-19 pandemic turned my economic modeling/business development job into a glorified telemarketing gig, I decided to drop out of the labor market for a little while to redevelop the mathematical and statistical skills I'd worked so hard to develop during undergrad, and try my hand in the world of technology. I explored web development and programming through Harvard's CS50x course, where I ultimately built an app I use every day to support my workouts. After some reflection though I felt that didn't involve enough of the math and stats that I enjoyed practicing in undergrad, which inevitably led me to discover the combination of business skills, programming, and math/stats that I've been looking for: data science. Preliminary investigation led me to believe that if not an outright requirement there's at least a strong preference for data scientists to have advanced degrees, and so unless I hear back from one of my reach schools, I'll be taking courses towards an MS in Data Science online from Johns Hopkins University starting this spring.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This background is helpful to understand that I've now been looking for an interesting project with which I could begin building a data science portfolio, and when I happened upon a <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/spending-for-ms-in-data-science-worth-it/\">notebook from a Kaggle competition</a> drawing conclusions that went very immediately against my current learning plan, I knew I had my subject. The author was a Kaggle notebooks grandmaster, this notebook had won 5th prize in last year's '2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey' competition, and the conclusions were effectively that one didn't need an MS to become a Data Scientist, and so I had to explore the data myself.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If the conclusions in the notebook were right, then I could be on the verge of spending a whole lot of money and time for a formal education I might not need in order to improve my opportunity and expected future earnings. If I listened to the conclusions and they turned out to be falsely negative, however, I would have to wait another whole year for the grad school application process to resume while passing my time building skills informally. Having been curious which of these categories his conclusions fell under, and having been curious how far the skills I've been developing taking <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/\">Jose Portilla's 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp' on Udemy</a> could take me in investigating his claims myself, I present my own exploratory data analysis of this survey and elaborate on some of the conclusions drawn by the author.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Without a question on the field of study of those that earned degrees, this <i>is</i> the most reasonable way to identify those that went to school to become data scientists. However, this approach overlooks the fact that since data science is so new, data scientists that were in school more than a few years ago likely didn't have access to data science curriculum, but rather, earned advanced degrees in related fields then transitioned in as data science grew in popularity. <b>As a result, the outcomes of older (and likely more experienced) respondents were used to argue that one did not need to go to school to become a data scientist, which I thought overlooked the fact that one still does need an advanced degree to become a data scientist.</b> One can see how this delineation can lead to a distorted view of the distribution of educational attainment among data scientists from the author's Figure 3, and how this lead to similar distributions of compensation between the two groups in the author's Figure 4.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yes, you read that correctly. The person that's about to spend ~\\$50k on an MS in data science is telling you that an advanced degree in data science won't earn you more money than your data scientist counterparts with mere bachelor's degrees. This flies in the face of reason, veteran economists, the admissions counselors for the reach schools that I'd like to flatter, and everybody in between. In 2013, the wage premium on a master's degree over a bachelor's was $12,000 <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/should-i-get-a-masters-degree.htm\">according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.</a> The BLS notes, however, that \"in some occupations, workers with a master's degree earned about the same as, or even less than, those with a bachelor's degree.\" They point to this happening in professions that don't often require advanced degrees, though, so this is an interesting dynamic. And at first glance at Figure 5, it's not a dynamic one would even notice.\n",

It's worth noting that there's only 10 observations in that category out of 706 total, and so that average is much more subject than the others to being skewed by outliers (like the two individuals that alone bring the average up from \\$141k). These individuals may very well be those that dropped out of school to start their own company, but the rest of us shouldn't draw conclusions about becoming a data scientist based off the experience of a very limited number of entrepreneurs.

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before looking at the negative premium on Master's degrees, it's worth noting that <b><font size=4>there is a \\$2,022 premium on a Doctoral degree over a Bachelor's degree,</font></b> but this is due almost entirely to the large differences between Doctoral and Bachelor's degree holders with 1-2 years of experience and 20+ years of experience. So from this one could conjecture that in the initial transition into data science a Doctoral Degree will provide early acccess to higher paying opportunities, but that premium quickly goes away as experience becomes the predominant factor in a data scientist's success. It then appears that the average compensation for veteran coders drops off after 20+ years of experience, and the largest drop is for those with Bachelor's indicating there may be some ceiling on more senior level jobs for those without advanced degrees. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What's even better news is that <b><font size=4>there is a \\$74,400 premium on Professional Degrees compared to Bachelor's</font></b> for data scientists with 1-5 years of experience. Now, it's again worth noting that there are only 10 individuals with Professional degrees in this sample, and so the categorical averages are once again subject to being skewed by outliers. Without any established Professional degrees in the formal data science discipline, however, one might assume these are individuals transitioning into data science from senior positions in related fields (like professional engineers or PE's, for example),which might suggest that data science would be a lucrative vertical to transition into for individuals with professional backgrounds.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally, for those with less than 20+ years of experience, <b><font size=4>data scientists with Bachelor's degrees make on average \\$6,030 more than those with Master's degrees and the same amount of experience.</font></b> It's hard to say why this might be the case. Perhaps those with Bachelor's degrees have to work harder to get their foot in the door, and so they come into their jobs with better portfolios. Perhaps they are less likely to get stuck in purely technical roles, and have a higher likelihood of moving upward into higher-paying managerial roles with the same amount of experience. This finding came as a surprise though, so I created the swarm plot in Figure 7 to see if there were any outliers in either category that might be skewing the categorical averages. See below.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Re-examining the premium on the Doctoral degree over the Bachelor's degree first, we see that <b>the large difference in compensation in the 1-2 years category persists</b> when excluding outliers, confirming that <b>in the initial transition into data science a Doctoral degree will allow access to higher-paying opportunities than a Bachelor's degree. Compensation is otherwise equal for the rest of data scientists' careers, however,</b> when we realize from Figure 7 that the data for Bachelor's with less than 1 year or 20+ years has an average of 2 observations after excluding outliers, and so ought not be used to draw firm conclusions. Thus, if one already has more than a few years coding experience, going back to school for a Doctoral Degree will not earn one more money as a data scientist.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Next, re-examining the premium on the Professional degree over the Bachelor's degree, we see that the premium holds even when excluding very high or very low earners. Now, it also holds between 1 and 20 years of experience where previously it only held in the first 5; Data scientists with <b>Professional degrees earn on average $38,700 more than their counterparts with Bachelor's degrees and the same amount of experience.</b> I still expect that those with professional degrees are those coming <i>from</i> another discipline into data science, but perhaps one could conclude a strategy for earning even greater compensation would be to complement a Master's or Bachelor's degree in data science with a professional degree or certificate in another field. It seems reasonable to believe that the highest paying jobs would be those that require the skillsets from multiple advanced disciplines, and so perhaps bringing a data science approach to other advanced fields yields particularly high compensation. It's worth noting again, however, that after excluding outliers there's now only 7 observations that populate the average compensation of Professional degree holders above, and so conclusions based on these data might not hold if we had more data.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally, re-examining the negative compensation premium for Master's degrees over Bachelor's, we see that the relationship seen in Figure 6 persists when we exclude those that are either likely not working full time or draw their income as something other than a staff data scientist. Noting from Figure 7 that there's an average of 2 observations for Bachelor's holders with either less than 1 or 20+ years of experience, we can exclude those categories and find that <b><font size=4>data scientists with Bachelor's degrees earn on average $2,900 more compensation per year than those with Master's degrees.</b></font> Again, it's hard to say why exactly this might be the case. Perhaps those with Bachelor's degrees are more likely to transition into managerial roles, or conversely, less likely to be railroaded into pure development roles. Perhaps those with Bachelor's degrees are more likely to be hired from within, and so they're able to negotiate slightly better salaries.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whatever the cause of this discrepancy in compensation may be, it's important to note that one should not conclude that an MS in data science is <i>never</i> worth it based on this finding alone, because this finding says nothing about the ability to become a data scientist with each type of degree. This finding only looks at individuals that have already become data scientists; it could very well be the case that it's much harder to become a data scientist with a Bachelor's degree than it is with an advanced degree. This is where the way the author framed his analysis led to the wrong conclusion. \n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first inappropriate assumption here is that one can take conclusions drawn from the prevalence of in-school data science education of <b>current</b> data scientists, and apply those conclusions to <b>future</b> data scientists. This is inappropriate because it overlooks the fact that data science education was likely inaccessible for the majority of current data scientists when they were in school, but that won't be the case for prospective data scientists moving forward. Consider the fact that data science is a very young discipline, and wasn't taught in university settings before roughly 2015. This means that data scientists that graduated from their terminal degree more than roughly 5 years ago would not have been able to learn data science in school. They likely learned advanced mathematics, statistics, or programming, but not what they would call data science. Drawing the conclusion that these data scientists didn't learn data science in school because there were cheaper, more accessible ways to learn it at the time, then, is unsupported. Looking at Figures 9a and 9b, we can see how access to data science is affected by age.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There's a nearly 4-year age difference between those that studied data science in school versus outside school, which is nearly the entire time data science has been offered in a university setting. Further, consider how <b>the share of learners studying data science in school rises among younger cohorts, even exceeding 50% among the youngest data scientists</b> as seen in Figure 9b. Based on the overall trend exhibited in Figure 9b we can infer that as more and more graduates age into the data scientist work-force this share will continue to steadily increase, meaning that we can expect the majority of new entrants to the data science labor pool to have studied in school moving forward. <b><font size=4>If individuals want to be competitive when just transitioning into the labor pool now, then, they'll want to be in the majority learning data science in school.</b></font>\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second inappropriate assumption in the author's conclusion above is that because most current data scientists didn't get an advanced degree in data science, they don't have an advanced degree. Now this may be putting words in the author's mouth, but I would argue this assumption is made because the author concludes that advanced degrees in general may or may not be worth it if one wants to transition into data science. This assumption is obviously false, and whether or not the author is making this assumption, he's omitting the fact that the overwhelming majority of data scientists do have advanced degrees. <b><font size=4>Of the 782 American data scientists</b></font> in the 2019 Kaggle Survey, <b><font size=4>11 did not complete at least a bachelor's degree,</b></font> and <b><font size=4>81% had advanced degrees,</b></font> as seen in Figures 10a and 10b.\n",

So one may or may not be able to obtain the same quality of education and experience from the cheaper, more accessible online learning platforms as they could from a full university setting, but the fact is that <b><font size=4>if one doesn't have some sort of advanced degree, they're at best in the bottom 20% of applicants in terms of credentials.</b></font> Further, if we're talking about those that are looking to transition into data science from another discipline, those individuals likely don't have the necessary experience that would justify hiring them over somebody with a masters.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The simple fact of the matter is that while it leads to otherwise qualified and competent individuals being excluded, <b><font size=4>educational credentials are one of the first indicators employers use to narrow down a pool of applicants</b></font> to a more reasonable level. There is a whole school of thought in education economics called 'screening theory' that seeks to explain this, and it's composed of some of the brightest economists in recent history (including J. Stiglitz, K. Arrow, D. Acemoglu and others). Their theory is that employers viewing an external candidate's application have no way of knowing the candidate' true competence, work-ethic, or ability without dedicating resources to giving them a phone screening, technical interview, or in-person interview. Given the fact that there's costs associated with these screening measures, employers seek ways to minimize the number of applicants that are extended these resources, assuming their screening approach leaves an adequate number of remaining candidates that have a higher likelihood of being successful. This is why at least <a href=\"https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/The_Quant_Crunch.pdf\"><b><font size=4>39% of data scientist postings require advanced degrees.</b></font></a> And if you perform a quick review of the distribution of educational attainment amongst the applicants to data science positions on LinkedIn using LinkedIn Premium, you'll usually find that about 80-90% of candidates have at least a Master's degree. So while there may be cheaper, quicker ways to gain the education and experience necessary to work as a data scientist, having that advanced degree will provide individuals access to the other 39% of all data science postings and help get past the first phase of the hiring process.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is worth noting however that this justification for obtaining an MS in data science does allow for some exceptions, most notably, those that already have another advanced degree. Given the author's finding that only 27% of current data scientists in the US learned data science in school, it stands to reason that the large majority of advanced degree holders applying to data science jobs do not necessarily have a degree in data science. That being said, <b><font size=4>if an individual has an advanced degree in a related field and can otherwise demonstrate their ability as a data scientist, an MS in data science may not be worth it.</b></font> Further, note that that screening argument focused on the difficulty associated with discerning <i>external candidates'</i> true ability. This does not hold true for internal candidates, whose ability is already well known by the employer. <a href=\"https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:336448/fulltext.pdf\">Studies</a> have found that \"while educational credentials (are) key 'to getting in the door' at an organization, <i>promotions</i> (tend) to be based on directly observable performance.\" Thus, <b><font size=4>if a quality employee of an organization that hires data scientists can demonstrate their ability as a data scientist, they're a much more attractive candidate than those whose abilities are unknown.</b></font> For these individuals, devoting the time and money to obtaining an MS in data science may be a worse route than demonstrating their skills on the job. I suspect this describes the 11 data scientists in this survey that have only a Bachelor's degree.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In <a href=\"#10\">Section 3</a> we saw that for anybody with a bachelor's degree or less formal education looking just to get their foot in the door, it's 100% worth it to pursue an MS in data science because you need one in order to be competitive with the overwhelming majority of data scientists. This isn't necessarily the case for those who already have an analytical foot in the door, though, as these individuals have the opportunity to lend support to data science projects internally and rise to the role of data science that way. It's also likely a better option to build a portfolio of data science projects through lower-cost platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Kaggle etc. for those with advanced degrees in related fields, as well, because since data science is so new, hiring managers don't yet discriminate between the kind of advanced degree so long as the skills are there.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In <a href=\"#5\">Section 2</a> we found that while advanced degrees in data science may be a good way for individuals to get their foot in the door, they're generally not worth the time and money for existing data scientists looking to increase their earnings. Very early in a data scientist's career a Doctoral degree may provide them access to higher paying opportunities, but after their first two years, everybody else's experience will allow them to catch up. Otherwise, it may be even more impressive for an applicant already having a data scientist title to have a bachelor's degree, as data scientists with Bachelor's degrees earn roughly $2,900 per year more than their Master's degree counterparts with the same level of experience. For those individuals just seeking to increase their compensation, an MS in data science would not be worth it. Interestingly those with Professional degrees earn far and away the most money, and since there's not yet any data science equivalent of a PE degree, this serves as an example of how you can dramatically increase earnings when filling roles that require multiple advanced skillsets. This may also point to the value of professional certification programs more broadly as opposed to full-fledged degrees, such as the well respected certifications profered by <a href=\"https://education.dellemc.com/content/emc/en-us/home/certification-overview.html#vert-click14\">Dell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science\">IBM</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-scientist\">Microsoft</a>.\n",

    "    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally, for someone with a Bachelor's degree looking to work their way back into the labor market as a data scientist, I'm now that much more confident that an MS in data science will be worth it for me. I look forward to starting data science courses at Johns Hopkins or otherwise this spring, and to pursuing one of those certifications from there!\n",
